## Context
Music has been called the greatest human creation throughout history. The fundamental definition of music is pure and unadulterated creativity. Music is a crucial element of our lives since it allows us to express our emotions and sentiments. Some people regard music as a means of escaping from life’s difficulties.

Many researchers found that music has benefits to medical treatment. Music boosts our mood and well-being, and music therapy may help during treatments for certain health conditions.

## My Role and Objectives

## Choice of colours and and layout

#### Complementary Colour

 Orange and Blue is complementary colour. Color theory states that the bigger the difference between two colors, the higher the level of contrast. They represent warmth and cold, earth and sky, land and sea, fire and ice. This extends to more abstract concepts, as well, such as passion and indifference.

#### Color Psychology
Orange is used to heal the lungs and to increase energy levels. Blue is believed to soothe illnesses and treat pain.

#### Layout
Top Bar Buttons indicate the percentage of respondents per Age Group. It's also use to control and show the various Data based on Age Group. The overal data size is consistent and rigid to have a clean and clearer look and feel.
